# workflow-glsp

This package contains the configuration for the GLSP diagrams of the Workflow example language.
It contains the base code that is independent from the actual application framework and integration variant.
Separating this base configuration and the actual integration code means that it can be reused for various different integration variants of the GLSP Workflow example language e.g in a Theia application, Standalone application, VS Code plugin or integrated into the Eclipse IDE.

## Building

This package is built with `yarn` and is available from npm via [@eclipse-glsp-examples/workflow-glsp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-glsp-examples/worfklow-glsp)
